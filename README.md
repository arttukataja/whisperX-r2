# Project description

This is a bug fixed fork of the original [WhisperX project](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) 
optimized for long Finnish audio files.

The project includes mp3_file_monitor.py script that listens 
to a ./input/ directory and outputs transcriptions to ./input/<subdir>/ directory.
